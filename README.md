# Prime Solo Project - Creating a Base Project

Creating base projects is something that will serve you well. With what you know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the basics. We will be adding onto it throughout the program, so while considering this setup process, ensure you pick a repo name that represents what will happen throughout the program.

“Base Project” is a name that would work well in this case. 

Here are the steps that need to be completed in the allotted time:
* Create a new repository on GitHub,
* Create a new project (folder in this case) on your machine,
* Initialize a Git repository in that project,
* Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page,
* Create an app.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site, make sure in comments to include the Author and Date of creation,
* Create a stylesheet.css, no population of content needed at this time,
* Link the Javascript and CSS file to your HTML file,
* Check this project into GitHub,
* Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the components of your projects
